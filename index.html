	<h1>O'Hara Solar Panel Installation Orange County	</h1>
	<p>
	O’Hara Solar was formed to solve Orange County’s major problem in the solar industry of long installation times. Customers are waiting months and months to have their solar panels installed, which isn’t acceptable to us because no client should ever be forgotten about. The entire team at O’Hara Solar is always ready to work for you and to help you to start generating cleaner, more efficient and less expensive energy from the sun! We keep the solar process simple, starting from the moment you contact us. The first thing we will do is ask you for a copy of our last utility bill, and within 24-hours one of our Energy Experts will be ready to present your solar proposal. We can either do this in your home, over the phone or on Zoom. We’ll analyze your utility bill to show you exactly what you are paying your utility provider for, then we’ll show you how much you’ll save with solar. We’ll explain how the tax credits work and if you qualify for it, then we’ll show you our design, and where on your roof we believe your solar panels should be placed for maximum energy production and thus, maximum savings! We can remove and add panels on our software during your live solar presentation, so you can see all the places available for solar panels and you can tell us where you want the panels. After you’ve seen all of this, we’ll present the finance options available to you if you choose to not pay cash for your solar system and take advantage of our popular $0 out-of-pocket program. Once you are happy and we sign our solar contract, one of our engineers will come out to your house for a Site Survey. During this survey we inspect your roof, to make sure it’s good for solar. If it’s not, we’ll tell you and if needs be, our team can put a new roof on your home as part of our solar package. Our electrician will inspect your main service panel and other parts of the electrical workings of your home. After this, we draw up your solar design plans and submit them to the city for permitting. Once we have the permit, we will schedule your installation for the next day. A city inspector will come out to sign off on the project and once your utility provider gives ‘Permission To Operate’, you’re officially running your home on solar energy! We don’t waste any time at any point of this process, which is why we are the fastest solar installer in Orange County.
